migxElementsManager is an Extra, based on MIGXdb to manage Elements, like Chunks, Snippets, Plugins, Templates and TVs.

Currently you can just define a (package) - path for each Category, where Elements of a Category can be saved as files. With the export, a json - file is exported, too with all Elements-Informations for later importing them at another Installation.

On the roadmap is the possibility to import exported Elements from that files and to Edit Elements from grid.

This will be a quick and simple way to transport Elements between Installations without the need of a package-build.
